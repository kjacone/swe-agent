# AI-Powered Code Generation Workflow - Architectural Document

## Overview
This document details the architectural workflow of an AI-powered code generation system. The system follows a structured process where user requests are analyzed, necessary modules are identified, and code is generated in a modular, human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach. This ensures that the user has control over the process and can intervene when necessary.

## System Architecture
The workflow consists of multiple interconnected nodes that perform specific tasks. Below is a breakdown of each node and its function:

### **1. Analyze/Coordinate**
- This node serves as the initial entry point for user requests.
- It performs natural language processing (NLP) to understand user input.
- It engages in small talk to improve user experience and asks for any missing information.
- Once the request is fully understood, it moves to the next step.

### **2. Extract Modules & User Feedback**
- The system analyzes the userâ€™s request and extracts the necessary modules required for code generation.
- The identified modules are presented to the user for selection.
- This step follows the HITL approach, allowing the user to manually confirm or modify module selection before proceeding.

### **3. Generate Steps & Code for Each Module**
- For each selected module, the system generates a set of steps required to create the code.
- It processes modules in a sequential order, starting with the first one in the checklist.
- The generated steps are then sent for code execution.

### **4. Route Module to the MCP Server**
- Based on the chosen framework (e.g., Python, Java, Node.js, etc.), the system routes the module to the appropriate MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.
- The MCP server ensures that the module is processed correctly according to the predefined framework.

### **5. MCP Server Generates Complete Code**
- The MCP server processes the module and generates a fully functional code snippet.
- The system ensures that the generated code adheres to best practices and predefined architecture standards.

### **6. Generate Docker Container, Build & Run Code**
- After code generation, the system creates a Docker container.
- The code is built, compiled, and executed within the containerized environment.
- This step ensures portability and consistency across different development environments.

### **7. Error Handling & Retry Mechanism**
- If there are errors or execution failures, the system attempts to fix the issues automatically.
- It retries the code generation and execution process up to **five times** before escalating the issue.
- If the error persists, the process moves to the HITL intervention step.

### **8.User Decision on Error or Continuation**
- If errors persist after multiple retries, the user is asked to intervene.
- The system presents the user with two options:
  - React to the error (modify request, debug, etc.).
  - Continue to the next module despite the error.

### **9. Process Next Module Until Completion**
- If the user chooses to continue, the system marks the current module as complete and moves to the next one.
- This loop continues until all modules are successfully generated and executed.

## Conclusion
This architecture follows a structured approach to AI-driven code generation with built-in human oversight (HITL). It allows for efficient, modular code generation while maintaining flexibility and user control. The error handling and retry mechanism ensure robustness, while Docker-based execution guarantees environment consistency. This system can be further enhanced by integrating AI-powered debugging and automated testing.
